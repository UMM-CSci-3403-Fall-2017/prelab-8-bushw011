    * Then construct `numThreads` instances of this class (`ThreadedSearch`)
    * using the 5 argument constructor for the class. You'll hand each of

    * [50, 75), and [75, 100) as their sections to search.
    *
    * You then construct `numThreads`, each of which is given a different
    * instance of this class as its `Runnable`. Then start each of those
    * threads, wait for them to all terminate, and then return the answer
    * in the shared `Answer` instance.
